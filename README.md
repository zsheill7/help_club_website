# help_club_website

The main css file is style.css, which is in the path HTML/assets/css

There are 6 html files, one for each page in the website (example: index.html is the main page, then about.html, causes.html, contact.html, etc.)

Assets are like images and fonts and supporting stuff - there wasn't enough room in the repository to include all images
